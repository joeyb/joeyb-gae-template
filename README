Google App Engine Project Template

Google includes a very simple project template with the GAE
software, but it's really basic and I found myself rewriting a
lot of the same basic code at the start of any GAE project, so
I decided to make my own little project template.  If you're
familiar with GAE then the layout should be pretty self explanatory.

externals/
   Any third party modules should be placed in this directory.  This
   folder has been added to the python path, so you can easily import
   code from here.

handlers/
   I split up my handlers in separate files using a philosophy
   similar to Django's idea of applications.  For example, a blog.py
   file may contain a PostViewHandler, DayViewHandler, MonthViewHandler,
   etc.

models/

static/
   All static files (css, js, images) should go in here.

templates/
   The main template layout is base.html and I tend to create a subfolder
   for each "application" and stores its views in that folder.

Install Instructions:

1. Edit app.yaml and change the application name to the correct
   name for your application

2. Edit config.py and change the default settings

3. Run like any other GAE app

Credits:

Several ideas on the code structure/layout for this application
were borrowed from Bloog <http://bloog.billkatz.com/>, which is
a GAE-based blog.

This application includes BlueprintCSS since I use it in a lot
of my projects.  If you want to write your own CSS (I don't) then
feel free to remove it.
